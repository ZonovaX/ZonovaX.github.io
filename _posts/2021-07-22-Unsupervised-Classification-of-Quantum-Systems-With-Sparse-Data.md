Quantum systems are ruled by probability. In practice, this means that if you look at the same quantum system twice, you'll see something different both times. In order to get a full understanding of a quantum system, one has to take many pictures of it. However, the number of pictures required to distinguish two systems grows exponentially with the size of the system, making it practically impossible to do using the standard approach.
