Weather forecasting involves making predictions on an incredibly high-dimensional and chaotic system. The standard physics based simulations provide the cutting edge of accuracy, but are notoriously computationally expensive, and the computational cost to increasing their accuracy scales exponentially. Utilizing the pattern recognition abilities of AI has the potential to give faster predictions which scale more efficiently, allowing for more accurate predictions that reach further into the future.
